Finding an expert, a mentor, or a collaborator, in open source is a daunting task.

It's like trying to navigate a library without a card catalogue. What do you do when you want to find books of a certain genre, like fantasy or crime, when the library is organized exclusively by title?

It's like trying to find a document on some one else's computer, when all you know is the filename, but you don't know what folder it's in.






It's like going to the library to find a book about punk music. What do you do when the library has no card catalogue, and the books are organized by title?

The library is not organized in a useful way. The same is true of open source today. If you want to find help, mentorship or bond with other geeks about common interests and areas of knowledge, you are mostly helpless. The way that people want to find experts is incompatible with the way that the communities of experts are set up.
