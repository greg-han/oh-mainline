This directory contains users' Subversion repositories for the
Subversion-related training missions.  To make them accessible (and
therefore make it possible for users to do the svn missions), you will
have to serve this directory out using svnserve, as we use an svnserve-
specific authentication mechanism for commits.

However you go about doing that, set SVN_REPO_URL_PREFIX in settings.py
to whatever URL points to this directory.

For example, OpenHatch itself uses the following inetd.conf line:
svn stream tcp nowait deploy /usr/bin/svnserve svnserve --inetd --root /home/deploy/milestone-a/mysite/missions-userdata/svn/


(In addition to providing this information, this file is present to
make sure the directory it is in exists because Git won't version empty
directories.)
