This directory contains users' Git repositories for the
Git-related training missions.  To make them accessible (and
therefore make it possible for users to do the git missions), you will
have to serve this directory out.

However you go about doing that, set GIT_REPO_URL_PREFIX in settings.py
to whatever URL points to this directory.
